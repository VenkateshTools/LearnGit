Master , Main 
The main branch is the default branch
we can rename or delete git just considers it as another branch

Head
Current Play head (or the branch version or the current page we are in) Where we are

git branch
-> to know the branches in the current repository

git branch <branch-name>
-> creates a new branch with name branch name parameter

git switch <branch-name>
-> to switch between branches

git switch -c <branch-name>
-> create and switches to the new branch that we created

git checkout <branch-name>
-> to switch between branches

git checkout -b <branch-name>
-> crates a new branch and swithes to it

checkout vs switch 

if we make a change and add it then we need to stash or commit it before switching branches

git branch -D <branch-name>
-> deletes the branch 
-> we should checkout from that branch

git branch -d <branch-name>
-> deletes the branch but we have to make sure that it is fully merged
-> we should checkout from that branch

git branch -m <new-branch-name>
-> renames the branch
-> have to be on the branch that we want to rename

git branch -v
