Git Repository

git status
    -> status in the current Repository

git init
    -> initializes the repository
        -> on this command run there is a .git hidden folder gets created and whatever the changes that we make are going to get stored on this





Doubts-
Still don't know the difference between
git diff HEAD
git diff --staged
